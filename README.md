# 2Do

A Modern desinged Todo App built with Flutter.
Works on Android and IOS.
Avaible just for Android at the Moment, because it's not in the App Store.
It isn't in the Play Store eigther, but the APK can be downloaded and installed on request.


## Use

You can use this Todo App to write Todos or Reminders.
The App will remind you that you have something to do.
At the Moment this app does not have Notification. That's due to
the reason that it would have token much more time till the first version
is ready to be realesed


## Language

At the Moment this App is avaible in English, German and French.
I do not guarantee that all Translations are right or make sense.


## Design and Inspiration

This App is hold White and Dark Blue, because these were two of 
three favorite Colors of the Person I got the Inspiration from.
Sadly I couldn't find an Element to use beige on :(


### Human Interface Guidline and UX Design

2Do follows the modern states of UX Design and the Human Interface Guidlines.
We have the Intention that you can use 2Do without having to wonder how it works.


### UI Design
This App uses the Material Design by Google, which is mainly used in
Googles mobile OS Android. 
As a Consequence this App has a bit of an Android-like Look.
But I put a lot of effort into making it stand out and have a bit of it's own look, which is clean and - most important - easy to use
