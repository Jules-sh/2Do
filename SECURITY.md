# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The best way to be up to date and get the newest Features and Security Updates
is to download and install the newest Version released.
With the next Major Release, the other Versions won't explicit get
Updates. If you still want to use an older Version and still get Updates,
please contact the Contributer or create an Issue.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

The best way to report a Vulnerability is to
contact the Administrator or create an Issue directly in Github.
